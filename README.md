My First Python Code

# First Python Code
I started programming in Python around two years ago. When I first started,  I wasn't working on a specific project, instead I just made one file mini projects for fun. I put them in a repository here.

I seperated the repository into two different folders, shell and turtle. That's because when I first started, I only worked in two catergories, either it was executed in the shell with text, or it was a turtle project.
